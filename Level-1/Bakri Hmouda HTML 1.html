    <p>
        <i><b>World War II or the Second World War</b></i>, often abbreviated as WWII or WW2, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945.<br/> It involved the vast majority of the world's countries—including all of the great powers—forming two opposing<br/>        military alliances: the Allies and the Axis powers.
    </p>

    <h2>Start and end dates</h2>
    <p>
        It is generally considered that in Europe World War II started on <b>1 September 1939</b>, beginning with the German invasion of Poland<br/> and the United Kingdom and France's declaration of war on Germany two days later.
    </p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <h3>Europe</h3>
    <p>
        World War I had radically altered the political European map, with the defeat of the Central Powers—including Austria-Hungary,<br/> Germany, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire—and the 1917 Bolshevik seizure of power in Russia, which led to the founding
        of the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, the victorious Allies of World War I, such as France, Belgium, Italy, Romania, and Greece,<br/> gained territory, and new nation-states were created out of the collapse of Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman and Russian
        Empires.

    <h3>Asia</h3>
    <p>
        In 1931, an increasingly militaristic Empire of Japan, which had long sought influence in China[26] as the first step of what its government saw as the country's right to rule Asia, staged the Mukden Incident as a pretext to invade Manchuria and establish
        the puppet state of Manchukuo.
